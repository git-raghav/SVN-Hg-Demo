# Mastering Version Control: A Deep Dive into SVN & Mercurial

**Name:** Raghav

## Introduction to Version Control Systems

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for managing software changes, enabling collaboration, and maintaining project history.

---

## Types of Version Control Systems

1. **Centralized (CVCS):** Single central server stores all versions (e.g., **Subversion (SVN)**).
2. **Distributed (DVCS):** Every user has a full repository copy (e.g., **Mercurial (Hg)**).

---

## Why Use Version Control?

-   Tracks all changes and keeps a history
-   Supports collaboration among developers
-   Enables rollback to previous versions
-   Facilitates branching/merging for testing

---

## Subversion (SVN)

_A Centralized Version Control System_

### Key Features

-   Centralized repository
-   Revision-based tracking (r1, r2, ...)
-   Atomic commits
-   Directory-based branching

---

### SVN Command Workflow

#### Step 1: Verify Installation

```bash
svn --version
```

#### Step 2: Create Repository & Standard Structure

```bash
svnadmin create C:\Users\ajayr\Raghav-SVN-Repo
cd C:\Users\ajayr
mkdir Raghav-SVN-Temp
cd Raghav-SVN-Temp
mkdir trunk branches tags
svn import . file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo -m "Raghav: Initial structure"
```

#### Step 3: Checkout Trunk & Add File

```bash
svn checkout file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/trunk Raghav-SVN-Trunk
cd Raghav-SVN-Trunk
echo "Hello from Raghav's SVN trunk!" > trunk-file.txt
svn add trunk-file.txt
svn commit -m "Raghav: First trunk commit"
```

#### Step 4: Branching & Merging

```bash
# Create branch
svn copy file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/trunk file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/branches/raghav-feature -m "Raghav: Feature branch"

# Switch to branch
svn switch file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/branches/raghav-feature

# Edit in branch
echo "Branch work by Raghav" >> branch-file.txt
svn add branch-file.txt
svn commit -m "Raghav: Branch commit"

# Merge to trunk
svn switch file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/trunk
svn merge file:///C:/Users/ajayr/Raghav-SVN-Repo/branches/raghav-feature
svn commit -m "Raghav: Merged branch"
```

### Essential SVN Commands

| Command                        | Description                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `svn checkout <repo-url>`      | Get a working copy             |
| `svn commit -m "Message"`      | Save changes to the repository |
| `svn merge <branch-url>`       | Merge branches                 |
| `svn resolve --accept working` | Resolve conflicts              |

## Mercurial (Hg)

_A Distributed Version Control System_

### Key Features

-   Distributed repositories
-   Atomic commits
-   Simple branching/merging

---

### Mercurial Command Workflow

#### Step 1: Verify Installation

```bash
hg --version
```

![Mercurial Installation](/SVN-Hg-Demo/images/image10.png)

#### Step 2: Initialize Repository & Commit

```bash
cd C:\Users\ajayr
mkdir Raghav-Hg-Repo
cd Raghav-Hg-Repo
hg init
echo "Mercurial demo by Raghav" > hg-file.txt
hg add hg-file.txt
hg commit -m "Raghav: First commit"
```

![Mercurial Commit](/SVN-Hg-Demo/images/image12.png)

#### Step 3: Branching & Merging

```bash
# Create branch
hg branch raghav-feature

# Edit in branch
echo "Branch changes by Raghav" >> hg-file.txt
hg commit -m "Raghav: Branch commit"

# Merge to default
hg update default
hg merge raghav-feature
hg commit -m "Raghav: Merged branch"
```

### Essential Mercurial Commands

| Command                  | Description                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `hg init`                | Initialize a repository    |
| `hg commit -m "Message"` | Save changes locally       |
| `hg merge <branch>`      | Merge branches             |
| `hg resolve --mark`      | Mark conflicts as resolved |

## SVN vs. Mercurial: Quick Comparison

| Feature      | SVN                    | Mercurial    |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Type         | Centralized            | Distributed  |
| Offline Work | Limited                | Full support |
| Branching    | Directory-based        | Lightweight  |
| Performance  | Slower for large repos | Faster       |

---

## Best Practices

-   Use **SVN** for centralized team workflows.
-   Use **Mercurial** for distributed/offline work.
-   Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Raghav: Fixed login bug").
